## Commiting Your Changes

You can commit your changes as often as you would like to and you can also push it to GitHub on your branch frequently. The following commands can be used for that:


```sh
# Replace "filename" with the file you would like to commit. This can be done for multiple files.
git add "filename"
git add "filename2"
# ...
git commit -m "Message"
git push origin username-branch

```

The above commands will bring your changes to your branch on GitHub. To have those changes reviewed and merged in the master branch see [Pull Requests](pull_requests.md).
