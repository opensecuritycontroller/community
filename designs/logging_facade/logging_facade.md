# Using SLF4J Logging Facade
Currently, as of [osc-core / 02b8024](https://github.com/opensecuritycontroller/osc-core/commit/02b80247faa29b069d2b6082f2e866a2f71b0f20),
OSC uses the **log4j** logging framework directly. The goal is to add flexibility by having all the code reference 
the **slf4j** facade only. Behind the facade would be **logback**, **log4j** or another logging framework. The development team will be able to make that change with minimal effort.

## Background

The **slf4j** facade provides a common API, including logging levels: **error**, **warn**, **info**, **debug** and (since 1.4.0) **trace**. It detects the presence of one of several logging frameworks and uses it. 

We want to be able to use **slf4j** throughout the project because:
- It would then be easy to replace the logging framework behind the facade.
- The implementation log4j-1.2, currently used, is obsolete.
- A specific requirement is that plugin implementations be able to use our **slf4j** log configuration without any dependency on any of our packages. 
- Example implementations with **logback** and **log4j** have been added. See **LogComponent** under **osc-ui** and the security manager plugin projects under the two experimental branches, ![log4j_POC](https://github.com/dmitryintel/osc-core/tree/logging) and ![logback_POC](https://github.com/dmitryintel/osc-core/tree/logback).

## Design Changes
- All the osc java code to only import **org.slf4j** packages, except **osc-server** and **osc-export** bundles. 
- For **osc-server**, the following changes are required:
  - The dependencies added to pom.xml: **slf4j-api** plus some implementation dependency. (**slf4j-log4j12**, **logback**, etc.)
  - The **LogUtil.initLogging()** function is modified to initialize the selected logging framework and register with the context.
  - **osc-server/bnd.bnd** receives the following header:
  
    `Provide-Capability: osgi.service;objectClass=org.slf4j.ILoggerFactory`
    
- **osc-export** needs the same pom.xml dependency as **osc-server** and the logging framework must be listed in the \*.bndrun files.
- All other bundles inside **osc-core**, as  well as plugins, have to implement their own utility @Component classes to obtain the *ILoggerFactory* implementation from the OSGi framework and deliver it to the non-OSGi-aware classes via a static getter.
- Static fields are not visible across bundle boundaries, so every bundle which uses this mechanism will have to instantiate its own **LogComponent**.

The **osc-server/Server**, activate method needs to call the following method, for the case of **log4j**:


    //Actually, this code is wrapped into LogUtil
    
    public void initLogging(BundleContext context) {
   
        	if (context != null) {
	        	LogUtil.context = context;
	        	
	        	PropertyConfigurator.configureAndWatch("./log4j.properties");
	        	
	        	Log4j12ServiceProvider provider = new Log4j12ServiceProvider();
	        	provider.initialize();
	        	
	        	ILoggerFactory factory = provider.getLoggerFactory();        	
	        	context.registerService(SLF4JServiceProvider.class, provider, null);
	        	context.registerService(ILoggerFactory.class, factory, null);
        	}
    }


Within any other bundle which might potentially be a dependency of **osc-server** itself, we have to be careful. Requiring a logging factory service which does not become available until **osc-server** is active, we have to avoid a circular dependency issue. Hence the **OPTIONAL** reference and **GREEDY** policy option:

    @Component
    public class LogComponent {

        private static BundleContext context;
        
        private static final ILoggerFactory FALLBACK_IMPL = LoggerFactory.getILoggerFactory();
        
        private static AtomicReference<ILoggerFactory> loggerFactoryRef 
                    = new AtomicReference<>(FALLBACK_IMPL);
        
        @Activate
        public void activate(BundleContext context) {
            LogComponent.context = context;     
        }
        
        @Reference(cardinality=OPTIONAL, policyOption=GREEDY)
        public void setLoggerFactoryInst(ILoggerFactory instance) {
            setLoggerFactory(instance);     
        }
        
        public static Logger getLogger(Class clazz) {
            return getLogger(clazz.getName());
        }
                
        // Intended for use by non-osgi - aware components  in this bundle only
        public static Logger getLogger(String className) {
            return loggerFactoryRef.get().getLogger(className);
        }
                
        private static void setLoggerFactory(ILoggerFactory instance) {
            loggerFactoryRef.accumulateAndGet(instance, (prev, next) -> next != null ? next : prev);
        }        
    }
    
Any bundle which is guaranteed to not be a dependency of the **osc-server** -- a plugin, for example -- can get away with a similar but simpler **LogComponent**.  It may use only static *loggerFactory*, which is presumed to be non-null throughout the code. No fallback implementation or atomic references are necessary.

## Logging framework options

Several logging frameworks have been considered to use with **slf4j**. **Logback** is the recommended one.

- **logback** -- [More robust](https://logback.qos.ch/reasonsToSwitch.html) than **log4j2**.
  - Groovy or XML configuration.
  - Log rotation and compression.
  - Well tested.
  
- **log4j2** version 2 -- very common and is currently used by most of the project directly. Considered second best.
  - XML, YAML or JSON configuration.

- **log4j** -- Not actively maintained, though it significantly [outperforms](http://blog.takipi.com/the-logging-olympics-a-race-between-todays-top-5-logging-frameworks/) its successor, according to some benchmarks.

- **jacarta.commons.logging (jcl)** -- according to the [slf4j](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html) documentation, buggy and not entirely reliable.

- **java.util.logging (jul)** -- level naming not compatible with the others. Also, it is [rather unpopular](http://blog.takipi.com/is-standard-java-logging-dead-log4j-vs-log4j2-vs-logback-vs-java-util-logging/).

- **slf4j-simple** -- according to the [slf4j](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html) this one is suitable for smaller projects. Only one "appender," fewer features.
